This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict housing prices based on various features. The dataset used for this project is obtained from the Kaggle competition, [Housing Prices Competition for Kaggle Learn Users](https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-data-for-ml-course).

## Dataset

The dataset comprises several features of houses, which are used to predict the price of the houses. The features include the area of the house, the number of bedrooms, the number of bathrooms, the neighborhood, and many others.
